1. Create a "matches" array containing other arrays representing basketball games. Each match array will have a home team and a visiting team, points made by the home team and points made by the visiting team. Print it all out on the screen.
2. Pass name, mail, and age as GET parameters and verify (looking for methods we don't know about in the documentation) that: name is longer than 3 characters; mail contains a period and a snail; age is a number. If everything is ok print "Access successful", otherwise "Access denied"
